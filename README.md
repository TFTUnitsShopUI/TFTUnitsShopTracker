(These are general instructions I've sent to friends so far, not actually proper readme for now)

Have to be on BORDERLESS either 1080p or 1440p.

How to use:

    - Open/Run before the game start.

    - When you see a champion in the shop that is MARKED and you no longer want 
    (i.e. Sold, don't plan on 3 star, etc), click over the shop and RIGHT CLICK on the champion in the shop.
    
    - After the game is over, MIDDLE CLICK to reset the champions it keeps track of.

For now this overlay puts a small green symbol on the top left of the champion
cards in the shop IFF you have previously bought the champion.

Addendum: It would be helpfulif you see a champion that you have NOT bought but is marked,
 screenshot it or write down the champion's name and position in the shop (1-5) and tell me.
