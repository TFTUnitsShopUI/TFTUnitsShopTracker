Overlay for Teamfight Tactics that keeps track of your purchased units and allows you
to mark units that you wish to purchase as a way of building your composition.

Additional files required to run, either:
    - https://mega.nz/#!B1g2SYSb!4W6Ggz1skLFhLtpht8jvS2XhrmH3s9lE9F8GoHPEh1E

    - Manually download Riot's Data Dragon file and go to /(version number)/img/champion
    and put the champion folder into the same directory as the other files.



(These are general instructions I've sent to friends so far, not actually proper readme for now)

Have to be on BORDERLESS either 1080p or 1440p.

How to use:

    - Open/Run before the game start.

    - When you see a champion in the shop that is MARKED and you no longer want 
    (i.e. Sold, don't plan on 3 star, etc), click over the shop and RIGHT CLICK on the champion in the shop.
    
    - After the game is over, MIDDLE CLICK to reset the champions it keeps track of.

For now this overlay puts a small green symbol on the top left of the champion
cards in the shop IFF you have previously bought the champion.
